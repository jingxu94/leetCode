# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains Python solutions for LeetCode problems, organized in a structured manner.
Each problem is solved in a separate module, and the corresponding test module contains unit tests
to verify the correctness of the solutions.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `pysolutions`: This directory contains the Python solution files. Each file is named as
  `p{start_problem_number}to{end_problem_number}.py` and contains solutions for a range
  of LeetCode problems.
- `tests`: This directory contains the Python test files using the `unittest` framework.
  Each file is named as `test_p{start_problem_number}to{end_problem_number}.py` and
  contains test cases for the corresponding range of LeetCode problems.
- `utils.py`: This file contains utility functions and classes that are commonly used across
  the solution files.
